# AmazonPriceTracker

Tracks the prices of your Amazon wishlist items over time, and plots that data on a line graph

### Setup

Create a file on the project's root called `config.json`. Inside it, paste the following content and replace the info with your own:
```json
{
    "url": "[YOUR-AMAZON-WISHLIST-URL-HERE-WITHOUT-BRACES]"
}
```
